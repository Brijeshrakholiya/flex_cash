Hi<?php if (strlen($username) > 0) { ?> <?php echo $username; ?><?php } ?>,

Forgot your password, huh? No big deal.
Your password has been reset.

Password : <?php echo $pass;?>

You received this email, because it was requested by a <?php echo $site_name; ?> user. This is part of the procedure to reset a new password on the system In case of Forgot old Password. 


Thank you,
The <?php echo $site_name; ?> Team
