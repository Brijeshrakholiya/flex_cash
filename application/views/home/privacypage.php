    <li>Other Information Collected</li>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <td><span class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></span></td>
        <td><p>When you visit the FlexCash Platform, we collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is often associated with the portal you used to enter the Internet, like your Internet service provider (ISP), company, association, or university. Although an IP address may reveal your geographic area or ISP, we are unable to determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. We may, however, link the last IP address you used to access the FlexCash Platform to Personal Information you provide us. In addition, we may also collect a “Device Identifier” (a unique identifier for your computer, mobile device, or other device used to access the FlexCash Platform). Device Identifiers are numbers that are automatically assigned to the device you used to access the FlexCash Platform and may be linked to other information about your use, such as what pages you viewed, and to Personal Information you provide us, such as your name. While you may disable the use of cookies through your browser settings, we do not support the Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting. FlexCash uses cookies and other similar technologies and may use analytics to track what you do in response to advertisements for FleCash services on third party platforms such as search engines and social networks. Any use of Cookies or of other tracking tools, unless stated otherwise, serves to identify users and remember their preferences, for the sole purpose of providing the service required by the user. Failure to provide certain Personal Data may make it impossible for FlexCash to provide some, or all, of its services to you. Users are responsible for any Personal Data of third parties obtained, published or shared through this Platform and confirm that they have the third party’s consent to provide the Data to the Owner.</p></td>

<li>Information You Provide To a Third Party</li>
</ol>
<p>The FlexCash Platform includes links to sites or applications operated by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”) and plugins from Third-Party Sites.

FlexCash does not control any Third-Party Sites and is not responsible for any information they may collect. The information collection practices of a Third-Party site are regulated by that site’s privacy policy. We recommend reading any Third- Party Site’s privacy policy if you choose to enter or click on a plug-in.</p>
